        <h2 class="coloring"> A Little Bit About Myself:</h2>

        <p>I am currently 19 years old and working towards an associates degree in applied sciences<br>
           at Wake Technical Community College. My goal is to become a front-end developer that can design<br>
           quick, effective, and beautiful webpages that users can adore. I truly enjoy working and creating<br>
           with others and love meeting new people!</p>

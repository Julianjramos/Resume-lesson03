            <h2 class="slide1"> Developer Experience</h2>
            <p>Developer experience that I have at the moment<br>
               consists of front-end languages like HTML, CSS and minor <br>
               knowledge of PHP, Javascript, and Python .</p>

               <h2 class="slide1"> Skills & Attributes</h2>
            <p>Skills & attributes I consider myself to have include, <br> 
               a great communicator, I am often the first one to reach out <br>
               to my collegues if I notice an error. I am also good at <br>
               seeing multiple sides of arguments and can see where each peron is coming from.
               </p>

               <h2 class="slide1"> Education</h2>
            <p>I have a High School Diploma and am finishing up my first year at <br>
                Wake Tech. Community College. I am majoring in computer science but I <br>
                do not plan to pursue a 4-year university afterwards, but would attempt if <br>
                I feel it would give me a better chance at a better job.<br>
              </p>

               <h2 class="slide1"> Overcoming Obstacles</h2>
            <p>In my life, I have overcame plenty of mentally challenging & physically challenging obstacles.<br>
               I have handled family losses, I had gotten into a car crash the day before thanksgiving in 2017 and shattered both kneecaps.<br>
               Sure I could have just gave up when it got hard, personally I don't like to think of the negatives in <br>
               my life as they shaped me to be the person I am today. I try my hardest no matter the project or task I'm assigned.<br>
               I hope to one day show off how far I've came, and just how much my setbacks and failures have fueled me further.
               </p>
